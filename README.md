## Why Streaky?

GitHub streaks represent consistency in your coding habits. Don't let a busy day break your streak - Streaky keeps you on track with timely reminders.

### Your Data is Safe

We understand you're trusting us with sensitive credentials (GitHub PAT, Discord webhooks, Telegram tokens). Here's how we protect them:

- **AES-256-GCM Encryption** - All tokens encrypted in database with industry-standard encryption
- **Separate Key Storage** - Encryption keys stored separately from database in Cloudflare secrets
- **Even if database leaks** - Your tokens remain useless encrypted blobs without the encryption key
- **Zero knowledge architecture** - We can't access your tokens even if we wanted to
- **Automatic key rotation** - Regular security updates and key rotation support
- **No third-party access** - Your data never leaves Cloudflare and Vercel infrastructure

**Bottom line:** Your GitHub PAT, Discord webhooks, and Telegram tokens are encrypted and secure. A database breach would only expose encrypted gibberish, not your actual credentials.

## Web App (Recommended)

**Live at [streakyy.vercel.app](https://streakyy.vercel.app)**

The easiest way to keep your streak alive:

- **Zero setup required** - Sign in with GitHub and start monitoring
- **Always running** - Cloud-based daily checks at 8 PM UTC
- **Distributed architecture** - Scalable to 40000+ users with isolated processing
- **Multi-platform notifications** - Discord and Telegram support
- **Beautiful interface** - Modern design with 3D animations
- **Enterprise-grade security** - JWT authentication, AES-256 encryption, secure key storage
- **Your data stays encrypted** - Database leaks expose only useless encrypted data

## CLI (For Developers)

Want full control? Check out the [CLI version](./cli/README.md):

- **Self-hosted** - Run on your own machine
- **Full privacy** - Your data stays local
- **Automation ready** - Perfect for CI/CD workflows
- **Python-based** - Easy to customize and extend

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xReLogic/streaky.git
cd streaky/cli
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

See the [CLI README](./cli/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

- Next.js 15 (React 19, App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- Spline 3D animations
- NextAuth.js (OAuth)

**Backend API:**

- Cloudflare Workers (Hono framework)
- Cloudflare D1 (SQLite database)
- Service Bindings (distributed cron processing)
- Analytics Engine (SQL-queryable metrics)
- TypeScript

**Notification Proxy:**

- Rust (Axum web framework)
- Tokio (async runtime)
- AES-256-GCM encryption

**Security:**

- JWT authentication with signature verification
- AES-256-GCM encryption for all sensitive credentials
- End-to-end encryption (Worker → Rust VPS)
- Separate encryption key storage in Cloudflare secrets
- API authentication with secret headers
- CORS strict allowlist
- Rate limiting (60 requests per minute)
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- Stateless VPS design (no data persistence)
